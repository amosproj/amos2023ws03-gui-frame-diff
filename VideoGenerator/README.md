# Video Generator

## Introduction

This project provides an abstract class for video generators called `AbstractVideoGenerator`. You can extend this class
to create your own video generator. It allows you to generate videos by adding frames and saving the video to an output
path.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- Java
- Gradle

### Installation

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine
2. Open Android Studio and select the directory `./VideoGenerator/example/` as project
3. Now, `gradle` should load the build scripts and show the modules `app` (example app) and `videogenerator` (library) 
4. You can now work on both the library and the example simultaneosly.

### Initialization

Your video generator should extend the `AbstractVideoGenerator` class. You can then initialize your video generator.

## Example App

The example app is used to try out the library and its functionalities.
If you're using something else than kotlin 1.9.0, you have to change the 
```
android {
    ...
 
    composeOptions {
        kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = "XXX"
    }
}
```

where you find the correct version number for `compose` (here)[https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-kotlin].

For the proper setup of the example project, these settings were necessary:
`example/settings.gradle`:
```
rootProject.name = "example"
include(":app")

include(":videogenerator")
project(":videogenerator").projectDir = File("../library")
```

`example/app/build.gradle.kt`:
```
dependencies {
    ...
    
    implementation(project(path = ":videogenerator"))
}
```
